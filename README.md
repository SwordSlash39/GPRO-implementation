# GPRO-implementation
Attempt at GPRO (policy network no value network) in non LLM scenarios

# GPRO
GPRO is known for its uses in Large Language Learning Models like Deepseek r1. However, while google searching about it, little was shown about its utilisation in other fields, especially because of the time save from disregarding the value network entirely. I experiement around using this technique of reinforcement learning in areas unrelated to LLMs like CartPole.
